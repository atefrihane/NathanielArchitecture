				<h2>Architectural Photography</h2>
				<p>
					Since 2011 Nathaniel has been scaling China's highs and lows documenting it's varied architectural manifestations for a range of western and Local clients. Often a lone cameraman amongst a sea of Chinese hard hats, part of the job has been to negotiate sites with little more than a grid reference and reference pictures in inhospitable new cities on the fringes of boom or bust development. Scrambling his way up a half finished sky scrapper fire escapes with little more than a telephone number and the name of a contractor called Zhou. In the summer of 2017 he relocated to London. He looks forward to shooting a very different type of architecture back home.
